## [Main Task](https://github.com/fabiohsst/LinkPredictionGNN/blob/main/link_prediction_heterogeneous_graph.ipynb)
This notebook aimed to perform a link prediction task using Graph Neural Network in a user-music interaction dataset from [LastFM](http://ocelma.net/MusicRecommendationDataset/lastfm-1K.html). Two link prediction was performed, user->listened_to->track - with an Average Precision of 62% - and user->listened_to_artist->artist - with an Average Precision of 97.99%.

## [EDA](https://github.com/fabiohsst/LinkPredictionGNN/blob/main/lastfm_dataset_EDA.ipynb) 
Exploratory Data Analysis were also performed to better understand the dataset that was used. For the data visualization, it was used [plotly library](https://plotly.com/python/), that permit the creation of interactive graphs.
